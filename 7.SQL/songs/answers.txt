1. I've no idea what colours represent what. The explanations on the page read like horoscopes.
   But, depending on their mystic's definition of words, maybe purple?
   The listener likes higher energy songs that can be danced to, but the valence is slightly leaning towards the sad end of the spectrum.

2. This method doesn't take into account how much the listener listened to each song.
   As an extreme example, a listener maye have listened to one high-energy, danceable song 1,000 times, and 99 slow, sad songs 1 time each.
   Those 99 songs would drag their averages way down and misrepresent them.
   I would give greater weighting to songs with higher play counts.
